Twitter Scrapping 

Social media scraping, in general, is best utilized when you are trying to understand some phenomenon that is taking place online.

In particular, Twitter data allows you to:

-Understand your own twitter network or the influence of your own tweets

-Collect data about tweeters (followers, friends, signup date, favorites, profile picture, etc.)

-Know who is mentioned through @usernames

-See how information disseminates

-See the influence/popularity of tweets and people

-Examine networks and communities

-Explore how trends develop and change over time
